> Questions I'm asking in interviews

In a fit of “open source your interview process”, I tweeted yesterday with the list of questions I’m drawing from when interviewing. A lot of people [responded in the gist](https://gist.github.com/jvns/8178076) with amazing suggestions, and I thought I’d consolidate them here so they don’t get lost in my pile of gists.

My basic strategy is to spend 20 minutes before each interview I do and pick some appropriate questions from this list. I’ve tried to categorize them a bit. A lot of these are outright stolen from [Edward O’Campo-Gooding’s list of questions](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/f7a161b5bc70), as well as from various people at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com/). I’d love suggestions for more!

Special thanks to [@bmastenbrook](https://twitter.com/bmastenbrook), [@marcprecipice](https://twitter.com/bmastenbrook), [@danluu](https://twitter.com/danluu), [@kelseyinnis](https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis), [@zmagg](https://twitter.com/zmagg), [@graue](https://twitter.com/graue), and [@ircolle](https://twitter.com/ircolle) for awesome question suggestions.

**Edit:** A few more things:

*   I don’t ask all of these in first interviews. Use your discretion, and do what you feel comfortable doing.
*   Asking a lot of questions shows that you value yourself and that you’re careful when making decisions. It’s a good thing.
*   If you have an offer, you can schedule extra conversations if you feel that not all of your questions have been answered.
*   It can be worth asking the same question to more than one person.

### Engineering practices

*   What version control system do you use? (if none, the interview should be over =))
*   Do you test your code?
*   How do you make sure that all code is understood by more than one person?
*   Do you do code review? Does all code get reviewed?
*   Do you have an issue tracker?
*   Describe your deployment process – how do you find bugs in your team’s code? What recourse do you have when you find a serious bug in production code?
*   Who is responsible for doing deployment? How often do you deploy?
*   How do you think about code correctness?
*   When something goes wrong, how do you handle it? Do devs get shamed for breaking the build?
*   How/when do developers talk to non-developers? Is it easy to talk to the people who are will be using your product?
*   Can I see some code the team I’m interviewing for has written? (from an open-source project you work on, for example)
*   Who are the people at your company with a lot of depth of experience? Will I be able to talk to them?
*   What’s your approach to technical debt?

### Management style

*   How does engineering work get assigned?
*   How are technical decisions made and communicated?
*   How do you balance support work and feature development?
*   Can you give me an example of someone who’s been in a technical role at your company for a long time, and how their responsibilities and role have changed? (I _love_ this question)
*   Do you have a dedicated designer? QA? Technical writer? Dev manager?
*   How often do you have meetings? Are there any scheduled/standing meetings? Who talks to customers (if appropriate) and how?
*   Has there been a situation where someone raised an ethical concern? If so, how was it handled? If not, have there really not been any?
*   How are decisions made? Is architecture dictated top down? Are ideas from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?
*   How are disagreements solved - both technical disagreements and other kinds? What happens when personalities clash?
*   Can you tell me about a time when you’ve had to let someone go?
*   Is there a written roadmap all developers can see? How far into the future does it extend? How closely is it followed?
*   How is performance evaluated?

### Quality of life

*   How much vacation do people get? If there’s “unlimited” vacation, how much vacation do people normally take?
*   Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?
*   How many women work for you? What’s your process for making sure you have diversity in other ways?
*   How many hours do people work in an average week? In your busiest weeks?
*   Is variability tolerated or is everyone expected to be on the same schedule?
*   What time do people normally leave work?
*   Would I need to be on call? How often?
*   How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?
*   What is your turnover rate like? How many devs were hired last year and how many left?
*   What’s your retention rate of women over 1.5 years? Do you think you could have done anything differently to keep people who left?
*   Do people work on the weekend?
*   Do people check in when they’re on vacation? How often?
*   Is it possible to work from home, say, 1 or 2 days a week? Does anyone do this? (can be a nice option to have)
*   Does this position require travel? How often?

As many of these as possible are “statistical” questions – a company may say that they “don’t have hours”, but if everyone leaves at 9pm that’s not a good sign.

*   Do you contribute to open source projects? Which projects? Which teams work on open source? Do you work mostly in the community or do you have a private fork?
*   Do your employees speak at conferences about your work?

### Career development

*   Are employees encouraged to go speak at conferences?
*   Do you cover travel to conferences? How many conferences a year do devs typically go to?
*   Does your company support continuing education? (will they pay for employees to do a master’s degree?)
*   In what other ways do you support career development?

### Culture

*   How do you determine if someone is a poor fit for your company?
*   How are your teams structured? What is the management structure like?
*   How often do you pair? What’s pairing like? How often do inexperienced people work directly with experienced people?
*   What’s the onboarding process like?
*   Is there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with plateauing or preventing burnout? (Expecting to hear about rotation of duties or location, sabbaticals.)
*   Is it easy to move to other divisions or offices?
*   How does internal communication work? This one is super important and I need to remember to ask it more.
*   Are there catered suppers? (possibly bad)
*   How many hours a week does senior management work? Do they put in 80-hour weeks?

### Financials/business model/growth

*   Are you profitable?
    *   if not, how does this affect what you can do? What’s your planned timeline for becoming profitable?
*   How do you make money? (I often explain to my parents or non-technical friends companies’ business models to test if they really make sense.)
*   How much are you planning to hire in the next year?
*   Are company financials, minus salaries, transparent throughout the company?

### Things to look for in real life

*   How is the office space physically organized?

### Other

*   Can you tell me about how the interview process is structured? How many interviews are there?
*   How often do you offer above asking? Can I speak with someone who got such an offer?
*   What do you wish you had known when you joined this company?
*   Why did you choose to join this company?
*   What’s the single biggest issue or problem facing the team/department/company?” What’s currently being done to address it?
