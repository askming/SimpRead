Abstract
--------

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as _Lactobacillus_. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory decline and cognitive impairment, and the number of people with AD is increasing because of global population growth and population aging[1](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR1 "GBD 2019 Dementia Forecasting Collaborators. Estimation of the global prevalence of dementia in 2019 and forecasted prevalence in 2050: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Lancet Public Health 7, e105–e125 (2022)."). The deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the formation of intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles are classic pathological hallmarks of AD and the leading causes driving subsequent neuroinflammation, synaptic impairment, neuronal loss and ultimate cognitive decline[2](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR2 "Hardy, J. & Selkoe, D. J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics. Science 297, 353–356 (2002)."),[3](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR3 "Huang, Y. & Mucke, L. Alzheimer mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Cell 148, 1204–1222 (2012)."). However, accumulating evidence suggests that these two processes alone cannot fully explain AD pathogenesis[4](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR4 "Herrup, K. The case for rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Nat. Neurosci. 18, 794–799 (2015)."). The notable efforts to develop treatment strategies for AD over the past decades, in particular by targeting Aβ, tau, neuroinflammation and other AD-related pathologies, have so far been incapable of stopping or delaying AD progression[5](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR5 "Doody, R. S. et al. Phase 3 trials of solanezumab for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. New Engl. J. Med. 370, 311–321 (2014)."),[6](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR6 "Salloway, S. et al. Two phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. New Engl. J. Med. 370, 322–333 (2014)."). The failure of these clinical trials indicates AD pathogenesis may be attributed to a systemic disorder involving multiple pathways or targets rather than a simple linear cascade of effects[7](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR7 "Morris, J. K., Honea, R. A., Vidoni, E. D., Swerdlow, R. H. & Burns, J. M. Is Alzheimer’s disease a systemic disease. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1842, 1340–1349 (2014).").

Intermittent fasting (IF) is a popular dietary restriction method with multiple benefits on human health, aging and disease[8](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR8 "de Cabo, R. & Mattson, M. P. Effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging, and disease. New Engl. J. Med. 381, 2541–2551 (2019)."). Emerging evidence shows IF is capable of extending lifespan[9](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR9 "Ulgherait, M. et al. Circadian autophagy drives iTRF-mediated longevity.

Intermittent and periodic fasting, longevity and disease. Nat. Aging 1, 47–59 (2021)."). Recent studies demonstrate IF shows promising protective effects on neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease[12](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR12 "Zhou, Z. L. et al. Neuroprotection of fasting mimicking diet on MPTP-induced Parkinson’s disease mice via gut microbiota and metabolites.

Time-restricted feeding improves circadian dysfunction as well as motor symptoms in the Q175 mouse model of Huntington’s disease. eNeuro 5, ENEURO.0431-17.2017 (2018)."). Moreover, multiple lines of evidence show improved outcomes of IF in AD by reducing AD-related pathologies and cognitive impairment in various models of AD[15](#ref-CR15 "Halagappa, V. K. et al.

SIRT3 mediates hippocampal synaptic adaptations to intermittent fasting and ameliorates deficits in APP mutant mice. Nat. Commun. 10, 1886 (2019)."). Nonetheless, the mechanisms through which IF ameliorates AD remain poorly understood.

Several studies revealed a correlation between AD pathology and gut microbiota dysbiosis[19](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR19 "Jiang, C., Li, G., Huang, P., Liu, Z. & Zhao, B. The gut microbiota and Alzheimer’s disease. J. Alzheimers Dis. 58, 1–15 (2017)."). Alterations in the composition and diversity of gut microbiota have been observed in AD mouse models and patients with AD when compared to healthy controls[20](#ref-CR20 "Vogt, N. M.

Sodium oligomannate therapeutically remodels gut microbiota and suppresses gut bacterial amino acids-shaped neuroinflammation to inhibit Alzheimer’s disease progression.

Modifying gut microbial composition and diversity with antibiotics (ABX) or probiotics reduces neuroinflammation and Aβ burden in different AD mouse models[23](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR23 "Minter, M.

Microbiota modulation counteracts Alzheimer’s disease progression influencing neuronal proteolysis and gut hormones plasma levels. Sci. Rep. 7, 2426 (2017)."). Recent reports even showed that replacing the gut microbiota by fecal transfer from wild-type (WT) mice is sufficient to ameliorate AD-like pathologies in APP/PS1[25](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR25 "Sun, J. et al.

Transfer of a healthy microbiota reduces amyloid and tau pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease animal model. Gut 69, 283–294 (2020)."). These studies have highlighted the gut microbiota is a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that IF exerts significant protective effects against several diseases (for example, obesity, autoimmunity, and diabetes) by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism[27](#ref-CR27 "Li, G. et al. Intermittent fasting promotes white adipose browning and decreases obesity by shaping the gut microbiota. Cell Metab. 26, 672–685.e674 (2017)."),[28](#ref-CR28 "Cignarella, F. et al. Intermittent fasting confers protection in CNS autoimmunity by altering the gut microbiota. Cell Metab. 27, 1222–1235.e1226 (2018)."),[29](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR29 "Liu, Z. et al. Gut microbiota mediates intermittent-fasting alleviation of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Nat. Commun. 11, 855 (2020)."). Considering the increasing connection between the gut microbiota and AD pathogenesis, and the potential regulation of gut microbiota by IF, it becomes useful to investigate the effects of IF on AD and explore how the gut-microbiota-brain axis is involved in this process.

### IF improves cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice

To investigate the effect of IF on AD pathology, 3-month-old 5XFAD mice were fasted on alternate day (5XFAD-IF group) or fed ad libitum (AL; 5XFAD-AL group). WT mice with food available AL (WT-AL group) were used as a control group. Behavioral testing and pathological analyses were conducted in ~5.5- to 6-month-old mice (Fig. [1a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)). A Morris water maze (MWM) study was used to detect spatial learning and memory abilities of mice. The results revealed that IF significantly improved the learning abilities of 5XFAD mice during the training trial when compared to the 5XFAD-AL group (Fig. [1b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)). Moreover, compared to the 5XFAD-AL mice, 5XFAD-IF mice displayed significantly shorter latency at the first entry to the target (platform), more target entries and more time spent in the target quadrant during the probe trial (Fig. [1c–f](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)), indicating better memory retention in the 5XFAD-IF mice. Of note, no obvious difference in swimming speed was observed among groups (Fig. [1g](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)), indicating that the alleviation of these phenotypes by IF did not result from altered motor ability.

Additionally, a novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed to examine mice cognitive ability (Fig. [1h](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)). Consistent with the MWM results, the NOR test showed that IF-treated mice preferred the novel object compared to the 5XFAD-AL mice group (Fig. [1i](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig1)), further suggesting better cognition in 5XFAD-IF mice. Together, these behavioral tests demonstrate that IF exhibits significant positive effects on cognitive impairment in AD mice.

### IF ameliorates Aβ burden and reactive gliosis in 5XFAD mice

To explore whether IF affects Aβ burden in AD mice, we used thioflavin S (TS) staining to detect Aβ plaque deposition in brain sections of 5XFAD-AL and 5XFAD-IF mice. The results showed that IF significantly reduced Aβ plaque deposits in typical brain regions, including the hippocampus and the cortex (Fig. [2a,b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig2)). Consistent with our TS staining results, western blotting showed that Aβ levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-IF mice compared to 5XFAD-AL mice (Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig8)). Additionally, we also performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to quantify the soluble and insoluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 fraction levels in the hippocampal homogenates, and results showed that IF significantly reduced the levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in both soluble (RIPA) and insoluble (SDS) fractions (Fig. [2c](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig2)). These data clearly showed IF reduces Aβ burden in 5XFAD mice.

Because AD is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease accompanied by abnormal activation of glial cells[30](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR30 "Heneka, M. T. et al. Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease. Lancet Neurol. 14, 388–405 (2015)."), we next performed immunofluorescence costaining of Aβ plaques (anti-6E10) along with antibodies against markers for microglia (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)). This process allowed us to examine the effect of IF on reactive gliosis in 5XFAD mice. Compared to 5XFAD-AL mice, we found that 5XFAD-IF mice displayed a lower number of Iba1+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes in the brain (Fig. [2d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig2)). In agreement with the immunofluorescent results, western blotting showed that the protein levels of hippocampal Iba1 and GFAP were significantly up-regulated in 5XFAD-AL mice compared to WT-AL. In contrast, IF treatment markedly reduced the expression levels of Iba1 and GFAP (Fig. [2e](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig2)), indicating that IF suppresses both reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in AD mice.

### IF suppresses mTOR signaling and activates autophagy in 5XFAD mice

It has been reported that hyperactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and impairment of autophagy were observed in aging and the context of AD[31](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR31 "Johnson, S. C., Rabinovitch, P. S. & Kaeberlein, M. mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease. Nature 493, 338–345 (2013)."). We next sought to investigate whether IF protected against AD by regulating these molecular pathways. Western blotting analysis of hippocampal lysates showed significantly increased levels of p-mTOR (S2448) in 5XFAD-AL mice compared to WT-AL mice (Extended Data Fig. [2](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig9)), suggesting that mTOR signaling pathway is activated in the context of AD. However, we found that IF treatment significantly suppressed the activation of mTOR, as reflected by the significant decrease of p-mTOR levels (Extended Data Fig. [2](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig9)). Moreover, we found that IF activated the autophagy pathway in 5XFAD mice, as evidenced by significant increases in p62 levels and an increased trend of LC3 II/I ratios when compared to 5XFAD-AL mice (Extended Data Fig. [2](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig9)). These data suggest that IF regimen can suppress mTOR signaling and activate autophagy in 5XFAD mice.

### IF alters the composition of gut microbiota in 5XFAD mice

After demonstrating the beneficial effects of IF on AD pathology and cognition, we next sought to investigate whether the gut-microbiota-brain axis is involved in the protective effects of IF against AD pathology. Accordingly, we collected mice stool samples at the end of the behavioral tests and performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The sequence data were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level. Principal-component analysis (PCA) based on the OTUs revealed a distinct clustering pattern among the samples from each group (Fig. [3a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig3)). Interestingly, the clustering plots in the IF group were clearly distinct from the AL group (including WT-AL and 5XFAD-AL), indicating that the IF regimen leads to alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota.

**Fig. 3: IF alters the composition of gut microbiota in 5XFAD mice.**[![](http://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43587-022-00311-y/MediaObjects/43587_2022_311_Fig3_HTML.png)](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y/figures/3)

[Full size image](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y/figures/3)

The top 10 relative abundances of key OUTs showed an enrichment in Firmicutes (class Bacilli) and a decrease in Bacteroidetes (class Bacteroidia) in the 5XFAD-IF mice (Fig. [3b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig3)). We next applied a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method to explore the differences in bacterial taxa composition in each group. Our results showed that 5XFAD-IF mice had an increased abundance of Lactobacillaceae (order Lactobacillales), whereas 5XFAD-AL mice had an enriched abundance of Muribaculaceae family (Fig. [3c,d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig3)). At lower taxonomical levels, we found that IF leads to a significant enrichment in the species _Lactobacillus reuteri_ (Fig. [3d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig3)), which has been associated with beneficial effects on human health[32](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR32 "Mu, Q., Tavella, V. J. & Luo, X. M. Role of Lactobacillus reuteri in human health and diseases. Front. Microbiol. 9, 757 (2018).").

We next used the Tax4Fun R package[33](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR33 "Aßhauer, K. P., Wemheuer, B., Daniel, R. & Meinicke, P. Tax4Fun: predicting functional profiles from metagenomic 16S rRNA data. Bioinformatics 31, 2882–2884 (2015).") to predict the functional capabilities of IF-induced alterations in microbial communities. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that significantly different biological processes included cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human disease, metabolism and organismal systems. Among these, metabolism had the highest number of genes and pathways (Extended Data Fig. [3a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig10)). Of the 35 significantly different pathways between the three groups, 23 were enriched in the stool samples of 5XFAD-IF mice versus 5XFAD-AL mice (Extended Data Fig. [3b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig10)). Interestingly, we observed the enriched pathways in the IF group were mainly associated with metabolism, including amino acid, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism (Extended Data Fig. [3b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig10)). Collectively, these results indicate that the gut-microbiota-metabolism-brain axis mediates the protective effects of IF against AD.

### Removal of gut microbiota attenuates the beneficial effects of IF in 5XFAD mice

Seeking to test whether the gut microbiota is required for the beneficial effects of IF against AD, a high-dose cocktail of ABX was applied to deplete the gut microbiota. Two-month-old 5XFAD mice were administrated with ABX by oral gavage every day for 7 days before the IF regimen, and ABX were administrated to the mice every other day throughout the experiment to maintain the removal of the gut microbiota (Fig. [4a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig4)). As expected, ABX treatment effectively eliminated gut microbes in 5XFAD mice, as revealed by significant inhibition of bacterial growth from fecal homogenates and significant enlargement of cecum (Extended Data Fig. [4a,b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig11)). According to 90 consecutive days of body weight and food intake recording data, we found that the curve of body weight gain of 5XFAD-AL was slower than WT-AL mice without evident difference in food intake (Extended Data Fig. [4c–f](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig11)). We did not observe that IF or ABX obviously affected the body weight or food intake of 5XFAD mice (Extended Data Fig. [4c–f](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig11)).

Of note, behavioral analyses showed that ABX treatment significantly diminished the IF-mediated cognitive improvement effects in 5XFAD mice, as indicated by longer latency to find the target (platform) during the training trial of the MWM test (Fig. [4b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig4)), longer latency at the first entry to the target, less target entries, and less time spent in the target quadrant during the probe trial of the MWM test (Fig. [4c–g](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig4)), as well as less recognition index in the NOR test (Fig. [4h](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig4)). Moreover, pathological analysis (TS staining) revealed that the ameliorative effect of IF on Aβ burden was also partially abolished by ABX treatment (Fig. [4i](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig4)). Together, these data suggest that the beneficial effects of IF against AD pathology require the alterations in the microbiome, at least partially depend on the gut microbiota.

### IF remodels metabolic pathways of gut microbiota in 5XFAD mice

To further investigate the potential mechanisms accounting for the protective effects of IF against AD, we performed metabolome profiling of cecal contents from WT-AL, 5XFAD-AL and 5XFAD-IF mice. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the clustering patterns were distinguished among each group (Fig. [5a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)). The classified metabolites revealed that amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were ranked as the top four most abundant metabolites (Fig. [5b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)). Of note, the IF group exhibited an evident increment in amino acids and organic acids metabolism compared to the AL groups (that is, WT-AL and 5XFAD-AL), with an obvious decrease in carbohydrates metabolism (Fig. [5b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)). At the individual metabolite levels, there were a total of 14 up-regulated and 28 down-regulated metabolites in cecum samples of 5XFAD-IF mice versus 5XFAD-AL mice (_P_ < 0.05; Fig. [5c](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)). The up-regulated metabolites were mainly classified into amino acids, whereas the down-regulated metabolites were associated with carbohydrates, SCFAs and phenylpropanoic acids (Fig. [5d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)).

**Fig. 5: Metabolomic profiles of cecal contents in IF-treated 5XFAD mice.**[![](http://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43587-022-00311-y/MediaObjects/43587_2022_311_Fig5_HTML.png)](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y/figures/5)

Among the most significantly different metabolites (top ten) in the 5XFAD-IF mice, seven were down-regulated (that is, D-glucose, D-ribulose, D-xylulose, D-fructose, D-xylose, butyric acid, and beta-muricholic acid) and three were up-regulated (that is, sarcosine (Sar), adipic acid, and dimethylglycine (DMG)) (Fig. [5e](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig5)). Interestingly, five of the seven down-regulated metabolites were carbohydrates, and two of the three up-regulated metabolites were amino acids. These two up-regulated amino acids, namely Sar and DMG, have been demonstrated to improve cognitive decline in toluene-induced memory impairment mice[34](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR34 "Chan, M. H., Chung, S. S., Stoker, A. K., Markou, A. & Chen, H. H. Sarcosine attenuates toluene-induced motor incoordination, memory impairment, and hypothermia but not brain stimulation reward enhancement in mice. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 265, 158–165 (2012)."),[35](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR35 "Hsieh, C. P., Chen, H., Chan, M. H., Chen, L. & Chen, H. H. N,N-dimethylglycine prevents toluene-induced impairment in recognition memory and synaptic plasticity in mice. Toxicology 446, 152613 (2020)."). Importantly, it has been reported that Sar and DMG are significantly decreased in the blood of patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)[36](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR36 "Wang, G. et al. Plasma metabolite profiles of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. J. Proteome Res. 13, 2649–2658 (2014)."),[37](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR37 "Horgusluoglu, E. et al. Integrative metabolomics-genomics approach reveals key metabolic pathways and regulators of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimers Dement. 18, 1260–1278 (2021)."). To determine whether the levels of Sar and DMG are also altered in our experimental model, serum and brain samples of mice were collected and processed for ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS) analysis. The results showed that the level of Sar in serum and the levels of Sar and DMG in brain tissues from 5XFAD-AL mice were significantly decreased as compared to WT-AL mice (Extended Data Fig. [5a,b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig12)). Interestingly, we found that the levels of these two amino acids in 5XFAD mice were significantly increased by IF treatment (Extended Data Fig. [5a,b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig12)). Together, these results suggest that IF might modulate the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiota and the subsequent production of metabolites, which in turn affects the host through circulation. This finding supports the aforementioned idea that gut-microbiota-metabolites-brains axis mediates the protective effects of IF against AD. Given that IF-enriched metabolites (that is, Sar and DMG) are associated with AD and cognitive function, it seems plausible that supplementing patients with these metabolites may prevent AD progression.

### Sar or DMG ameliorates cognitive deficits and LTP impairment in 5XFAD mice

To experimentally demonstrate whether IF-enriched Sar and DMG can mimic the effects of IF on AD, we administered Sar (500 mg kg−1 per day) or DMG (100 mg kg−1 per day) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in 2-month-old 5XFAD mice. The mice then underwent behavioral tests at 5 months of age and pathological analysis at 6 months of age (Fig. [6a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig6)). We first set out to determine whether exogenously supplemented with Sar and DMG could reach the brain. The serum and brain samples were collected from the mice after 1 h of i.p. injection with Sar and DMG (500 mg kg−1 and 100 mg kg−1, respectively), followed by UPLC-MS analysis. The results showed that the levels of Sar and DMG were dramatically elevated in both serum and brain samples of metabolite-injected mice compared to the saline-injected mice (Extended Data Fig. [5c,d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig12); ~290-fold and 59-fold increases for Sar in the serum and brain, respectively; 2,600-fold and 150-fold increases for DMG in the serum and brain, respectively), suggesting that exogenous Sar and DMG can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain.

**Fig. 6: Sar or DMG treatment ameliorates cognitive declines and LTP impairment in 5XFAD mice.**[![](http://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43587-022-00311-y/MediaObjects/43587_2022_311_Fig6_HTML.png)](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y/figures/6)

Data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. *_P_ < 0.05, **_P_ < 0.01, and ***_P_ < 0.001.

Next, behavioral tests were performed and the MWM results showed that Sar or DMG administration significantly improved spatial learning abilities in 5XFAD mice during the training trial compared to 5XFAD control mice (Fig. [6b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig6)). Moreover, Sar- or DMG-treated 5XFAD mice displayed better memory retention during the probe trial, as reflected by a significantly shorter latency at the first entry to the target and significantly higher target entries, with no obvious differences in swimming speed (Fig. [6c–f](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig6)). Additionally, NOR test showed that Sar- or DMG-treated 5XFAD mice exhibited more preference to the novel object compared to saline-treated 5XFAD mice (Fig. [6g](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig6)). Consistent with these behavioral analyses, electrophysiological recording showed that Sar or DMG significantly prevented the deficits of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in 5XFAD mice (Fig. [6h,i](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig6)). Together, these in vivo data suggest that daily supplement with Sar or DMG can ameliorate cognitive deficits and LTP impairment in 5XFAD mice.

To distinguish whether these metabolites specifically exerted anti-AD properties or just improved performance on the behavioral tests, 2-month-old WT mice were i.p. injection with Sar (500 mg kg−1 per day) or DMG (100 mg kg−1 per day) for 3 months, followed by behavioral tests (Extended Data Fig. [6a](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig13)). The results showed that Sar or DMG administration did not obviously affect the body weight or food intake of mice (Extended Data Fig. [6b–d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig13)). We also did not observe obvious difference of behavioral performance (MWM and NOR tests) in Sar or DMG supplementation versus saline-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. [6e–j](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig13)), suggesting that Sar or DMG could not improve the cognition of WT mice at this experimental age.

### Sar or DMG reduces Aβ depositions and reactive gliosis in 5XFAD mice

We next used TS staining to investigate whether Sar or DMG could ameliorate Aβ burden in brain sections of 5XFAD mice. Compared to 5XFAD control mice, Sar or DMG treatment significantly reduced the Aβ plaque deposit in different brain regions, including the hippocampus and the cortex (Fig. [7a,b](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig7)). In agreement with the TS staining results, western blotting analysis showed that Aβ levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of Sar- or DMG-treated 5XFAD mice compared to saline-treated 5XFAD mice (Extended Data Fig. [7](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig14)). Similarly, we also found that Sar or DMG administration significantly reduced both the soluble and insoluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 fraction levels in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice (Fig. [7c](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig7)).

**Fig. 7: Sar or DMG treatment reduces Aβ burden and the extent of glial activation in 5XFAD mice.**[![](http://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43587-022-00311-y/MediaObjects/43587_2022_311_Fig7_HTML.png)](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y/figures/7)

Data are represented as the mean ± s.e.m. *_P_ < 0.05 and ***_P_ < 0.001. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s _t_-test (b–d).

Additionally, we performed immunofluorescence costaining of Aβ plaques (anti-6E10) along with antibodies against markers for microglia (Iba1) and astrocytes (GFAP) to evaluate the effects of Sar or DMG on reactive gliosis in 5XFAD mice. Our results showed that Sar or DMG treatment significantly reduces the number of Iba1+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes in the brain of 5XFAD mice (Fig. [7d](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#Fig7)). This indicates that Sar or DMG treatment suppresses abnormal activation of microglia and astrocytes in the context of AD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Sar or DMG treatments mimic the protective IF phenotypes against AD.

Discussion
----------

An increasing amount of evidence shows that IF exerts multiple beneficial effects on human disease, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders and neurological diseases[8](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR8 "de Cabo, R. & Mattson, M. P. Effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging, and disease. New Engl. J. Med. 381, 2541–2551 (2019)."),[38](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR38 "Wei, M. et al. Fasting-mimicking diet and markers/risk factors for aging, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Sci. Transl. Med. 9, eaai8700 (2017)."). However, the specific mechanisms through which IF impacts AD remain unknown[39](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR39 "Nasaruddin, M. L., Syed Abd Halim, S. A. & Kamaruzzaman, M. A. Studying the relationship of intermittent fasting and β-amyloid in animal model of Alzheimer’s disease: a scoping review. Nutrients 12, 3215 (2020)."). In the present study, we show that IF displays strong protective effects in 5XFAD mice by reducing AD-like pathologies. We found that the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis is involved in the protective effect of IF against AD. Importantly, we demonstrate that IF-enriched metabolites, specifically Sar and DMG, mimic the protective IF phenotypes in 5XFAD mice. Accordingly, our study highlights the role of the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis in mediating the benefits of IF against AD and suggests that remodeling this axis is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

The gut-microbiota-brain axis includes the communication network between the central nervous system and intestinal microbiota. Several lines of evidence have implicated gut microbiota dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases, including AD[19](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR19 "Jiang, C., Li, G., Huang, P., Liu, Z. & Zhao, B.

Gut 69, 283–294 (2020)."). Importantly, emerging evidence highlights the close interplay between IF and the gut microbiota[27](#ref-CR27 "Li, G. et al. Intermittent fasting promotes white adipose browning and decreases obesity by shaping the gut microbiota. Cell Metab. 26, 672–685.e674 (2017)."),[28](#ref-CR28 "Cignarella, F. et al.

Gut microbiota mediates intermittent-fasting alleviation of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. Nat. Commun. 11, 855 (2020)."). In line with previous reports, our study demonstrates that IF has a striking effect on the composition of the gut microbiota. Of note, ablating the gut microbiota with ABX only partially blocked the beneficial effects of IF on AD pathology, suggesting that the effects of IF may relate to other pathways such as mTOR and autophagy. In particular, IF leads to a significant enrichment in _Lactobacillus_, a widely used probiotic with documented benefits in humans. Several studies reported that oral administration of _Lactobacillus_ protects against oxidative stress and systemic inflammation[40](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR40 "Saeedi, B. J. et al. Gut-resident Lactobacilli activate hepatic Nrf2 and protect against oxidative liver injury. Cell Metab. 31, 956–968 (2020)."),[41](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR41 "Panpetch, W. et al.

Moreover, the IF-enriched _L. reuteri_ species observed in our study has been shown to ameliorate various inflammatory disorders in humans and other animals[42](#ref-CR42 "Costanzo, M. et al.

Lactobacillus reuteri ameliorates intestinal inflammation and modulates gut microbiota and metabolic disorders in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. Nutrients 12, 2298 (2020)."). In tune with previous reports, our results show that IF dramatically reduces neuroinflammation in AD mice, as evidenced by the suppressed activation of microglia and astrocytes. It should be very interesting to further investigate whether artificially augmenting the levels of _L. reuteri_ in the host by supplementation with probiotics could reduce neuroinflammation and prevent AD progression.

The gut microbiota usually exerts functions through a complex interplay with host metabolism[46](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR46 "Usami, M., Miyoshi, M. & Yamashita, H. Gut microbiota and host metabolism in liver cirrhosis. World J. Gastroenterol. 21, 11597–11608 (2015).").

It is thus conceivable that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota through an IF regimen will result in their metabolic alteration. In fact, our functional analysis of the gut microbiome and the metabolomic profiling of cecal contents revealed obvious changes in the metabolic signatures of the gut microbiota following an IF regimen versus food AL. These changes include a significant increment in amino acid metabolism (for example, Sar and DMG) with a dramatic decrease in carbohydrate metabolism (for example, D-glucose, D-ribulose, D-xylulose, D-fructose, and D-xylose). Of particular note, insulin resistance and glucose metabolism disorders have been found to be associated with AD pathogenesis[48](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR48 "Talbot, K. et al. Demonstrated brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer’s disease patients is associated with IGF-1 resistance, IRS-1 dysregulation, and cognitive decline. J. Clin. Invest. 122, 1316–1338 (2012)."),[49](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR49 "An, Y. et al. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites as key actors in inflammatory bowel disease. Alzheimers Dement. 14, 318–329 (2018)."). Interestingly, SCFAs (in particular butyric acid), which have been shown to have beneficial effects in models of AD[50](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR50 "Fernando, W. et al. Sodium butyrate reduces brain amyloid-β Levels and improves cognitive memory performance in an alzheimer’s disease transgenic mouse model at an early disease stage. J. Alzheimers Dis. 74, 91–99 (2020)."),[51](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR51 "Jiang, Y., Li, K., Li, X., Xu, L. & Yang, Z. Sodium butyrate ameliorates the impairment of synaptic plasticity by inhibiting the neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Chem. Biol. Interact. 341, 109452 (2021)."), were found to be down-regulated in response to the IF diet in 5XFAD mice in our study, implying that the outcomes of IF on AD pathology were resulted from the systemic and comprehensive effects. Moreover, it was reported that SCFAs might also be harmful to the AD pathology[52](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR52 "Colombo, A. V. Microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids modulate microglia and promote Aβ plaque deposition. Elife 10, e59826 (2021)."), suggesting that the roles of SCFAs in the AD pathogenesis are complicated and controversial. Other IF-responsive factors, such as longevity gene _Klotho_ expression[53](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR53 "Dias, G. P. et al. Intermittent fasting enhances long-term memory consolidation, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and expression of longevity gene Klotho. Mol. Psychiatry 26, 6365–6379 (2021).") and ketone production[54](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR54 "Park, S., Zhang, T., Wu, X. & Yi Qiu, J. Ketone production by ketogenic diet and by intermittent fasting has different effects on the gut microbiota and disease progression in an Alzheimer’s disease rat model. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 67, 188–198 (2020)."), also deserve further investigation in AD. Collectively, these changes in microbial metabolic activity may, at least partially, account for the mechanisms through which IF ameliorates AD pathology. In addition, these observations highlight the importance of the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis in mediating the protective effects of IF in AD pathogenesis.

Another striking finding from our study is that Sar or DMG administration phenocopies the beneficial effects of IF in AD mice. This is important because Sar and DMG are common dietary supplements, making it possible for medical translation to prevent AD progress. Accordingly, Sar and DMG have been linked with cognitive functions. For example, serum Sar levels are decreased in aged rodents and humans, and Sar supplementation is beneficial for healthy aging by activating the autophagic flux[55](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR55 "Walters, R. O. et al. Sarcosine is uniquely modulated by aging and dietary restriction in rodents and humans. Cell Rep. 25, 663–676 (2018)."). There are also reports that Sar and DMG were significantly down-regulated in the blood of patients with AD and MCI, compared to healthy individuals[36](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR36 "Wang, G. et al. Plasma metabolite profiles of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. J. Proteome Res. 13, 2649–2658 (2014)."),[37](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR37 "Horgusluoglu, E. et al. Integrative metabolomics-genomics approach reveals key metabolic pathways and regulators of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimers Dement. 18, 1260–1278 (2021)."). Importantly, both of these two metabolites are capable of improving cognitive functions in toluene-induced memory impairment mice[34](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR34 "Chan, M. H., Chung, S. S., Stoker, A. K., Markou, A. & Chen, H. H. Sarcosine attenuates toluene-induced motor incoordination, memory impairment, and hypothermia but not brain stimulation reward enhancement in mice. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 265, 158–165 (2012)."),[35](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR35 "Hsieh, C. P., Chen, H., Chan, M. H., Chen, L. & Chen, H. H. N,N-dimethylglycine prevents toluene-induced impairment in recognition memory and synaptic plasticity in mice. Toxicology 446, 152613 (2020)."). In agreement with these reports, our study shows that daily supplementation with either Sar or DMG significantly prevents spatial learning and memory deficits in 5XFAD mice. In addition, AD-related pathologies, including Aβ plaque burden and reactive gliosis, are attenuated by Sar or DMG treatment. These similar positive effects of IF and IF-enriched metabolites (that is, Sar and DMG) on AD mice again support IF is able to mitigate AD pathology by modulating the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis. Our findings thus provide a therapeutic strategy for AD treatment by remodeling the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis.

Finally, it should be noticed that although our work and some previous studies[15](#ref-CR15 "Halagappa, V. K. et al. Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction ameliorate age-related behavioral deficits in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Neurobiol. Dis. 26, 212–220 (2007)."),[16](#ref-CR16 "Zhang, J. et al. Intermittent fasting protects against Alzheimer’s disease possible through restoring Aquaporin-4 polarity. Front. Mol. Neurosci. 10, 395 (2017)."),[17](#ref-CR17 "Shin, B. K., Kang, S., Kim, D. S. & Park, S. Intermittent fasting protects against the deterioration of cognitive function, energy metabolism and dyslipidemia in Alzheimer’s disease-induced estrogen deficient rats. Exp. Biol. Med. 243, 334–343 (2018)."),[18](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR18 "Liu, Y. et al. SIRT3 mediates hippocampal synaptic adaptations to intermittent fasting and ameliorates deficits in APP mutant mice. Nat. Commun. 10, 1886 (2019).") have demonstrated the beneficial effects of IF on different AD models, there was also inconsistent report that IF might be harmful to AD pathology[56](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR56 "Lazic, D. et al. Every-other-day feeding exacerbates inflammation and neuronal deficits in 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Neurobiol. Dis. 136, 104745 (2020)."). Therefore, future studies of IF regimen warrant more deepened investigation basically and clinically before this dietary approach being applied to treat AD.

Limitations of the study
------------------------

One limitation of this study is that although our study has demonstrated the involvement of gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis in the beneficial effects of IF against AD, it should be noted that not all of the effects of IF were mediated by the microbiome. Therefore, it will be important to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that accounting for the effects of IF on AD in future studies. Another limitation of this study is that alternate-day IF regimen in mice might not be feasible for human beings, especially in the elderly populations, for long-term treatment. Thus, developing and investigating modified IF regimens or fasting-mimicking diet that suitable for human beings will be necessary in future studies.

Methods
-------

### Mice

5XFAD mice with Thy-1 promoter-driven overexpression of K670N/M671L (Swedish), I716V (Florida) and V717I (London) mutations in human APP (695), as well as M146L and L286V mutations in human PS1, have been described previously[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."). We tested the genotypes of all experimental animals by PCR analysis of tail genomic DNA with the appropriate primers. The mice were housed four to five per cage on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to standard mouse chow (SPF-F01-002, SPF Biotechnology) and autoclaved water. The ambient temperature was maintained at approximately 22 °C with ~40%–70% humidity. Unless specifically indicated, only age-matched male mice were used in the experiments. All experimental animal procedures were approved by the Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee of the Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences (Beijing, China); the approval reference number is IACUC-DWZX-2019-504.

### IF

3-month-old 5XFAD mice were randomly grouped to either the AL or IF group. IF group mice were fed every other day (food was provided or removed at 8 pm each day) with unrestricted access to water. WT littermates with food and water AL were used as a control group. After 10-12 weeks of feeding the mice with the assigned diet (AL or IF), we conducted behavioral tests and pathological analyses. Stool samples were collected at the end of the behavioral tests for microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. During the IF experiments, all mice were individually housed.

### Gut microbial depletion

For gut microbial depletion, 2-month-old 5XFAD mice were administered orally with a high-dose cocktail of ABX containing ampicillin (1 mg ml−1), gentamicin (1 mg ml−1), metronidazole (1 mg ml−1), neomycin (1 mg ml−1) and vancomycin (0.5 mg ml−1). Briefly, 200 μl ABX was administered every day for 7 days before the IF regimen, and the same volume of ABX was continually administered to the mice every other day throughout the experiment to maintain the removal of the gut microbiota. Mice in the other group were administered with 200 μl autoclaved water. Behavioral tests and pathological analyses were conducted after 3 months of IF treatment in the presence or absence of ABX.

### Drug treatment

Two-month-old 5XFAD mice were randomly grouped to the vehicle, Sar (131776-100 G, Sigma-Aldrich) and DMG (N830787-25g, Macklin) groups. Sar (dissolved in saline; 500 mg kg−1)[58](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR58 "Pei, J. C. et al. Therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism of sarcosine (N-methylglycine) in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction models of schizophrenia. J. Psychopharmacol. 33, 1288–1302 (2019).") or DMG (dissolved in saline; 100 mg kg−1)[35](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR35 "Hsieh, C. P., Chen, H., Chan, M. H., Chen, L. & Chen, H. H. N,N-dimethylglycine prevents toluene-induced impairment in recognition memory and synaptic plasticity in mice. Toxicology 446, 152613 (2020).") was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) every day for 4 months. The vehicle group was injected with an equal amount of saline. WT littermates were used as a control group. Behavioral tests were performed with 5-month-old animals, followed by pathological analyses with 6-month-old animals.

### MWM

The MWM test was used to analyze spatial learning and memory performance in mice. MWM test was performed as previously described[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."). Briefly, the test was performed in a pool (110 cm in diameter) filled with opacified water (19 °C to 22 °C). The pool was artificially divided into four virtual quadrants. An escaped platform (10 cm in diameter) was randomly placed at the center of one of the quadrants 1 cm below the surface of the water. During the training period, the mice were allowed to freely swim for 60 s to find the platform. The mice that found the platform within 60 s were allowed to stay for 30 s; the mice that failed to find the platform were guided to it and also allowed to stay for 30 s. The training trial was performed twice a day, and the data were presented as the average of the two trials. The probe trial was performed 24 h after the last training trail in order to test the memory retention of mice. During the probe trial, the platform was removed and the mice were allowed to freely explore for 60 s. The swimming activity of each mouse was monitored using a video camera mounted overhead and was automatically recorded via ANY-maze behavioral tracking software (Stoelting). In the MWM test, shorter latency, more target entries and more time spent in the target quadrant represent better spatial learning and memory of mice.

### NOR

The NOR test was performed in an open field box (50 cm × 50 cm × 20 cm). During the habituation period, mice were placed in the open field box without any objects and free to explore for 5 min for 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day, the mice were placed in the center of the box with two identical objects (familiar object) to explore for 5 min in the first trial. The second trial was performed with 1 h delay with one of the objects replaced with a novel object. Time spent in exploring the familiar object or the novel object was recorded and analyzed with the ANY-maze behavioral tracking software (Stoelting). Object exploration was defined as the mouse placing its nose within the software-defined zone surrounding the object. This zone was defined as 1 cm from the object edge. Recognition index was calculated by dividing the time spent exploring each object by the total time spent exploring both objects. The equation is: Recognition index % = (Tnovel or Tfamiliar)/(Tnovel + Tfamiliar) × 100. In the NOR test, longer time spent on exploring the novel object represents better cognition of mice.

### LTP recording

LTP recoding was performed as previously described with some modifications[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."). Briefly, 7-month-old mice (WT, 5XFAD, 5XFAD + Sar and 5XFAD + DMG) were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (0.7%) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) cutting buffer (2 mM KCl, 1.3 mM NaH2PO4, 12 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 220 mM sucrose, 10 mM glucose and 26 mM NaHCO3). The brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated cutting buffer. Hippocampal slices were cut into 300 μm using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) and then transferred to an incubation chamber containing oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (126 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.6 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose and 26 mM NaHCO3). The hippocampal slices were held at 32 °C for 30 min and at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) for 60 min before transferring to the recording chamber. For recording, the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were evoked in the CA1 stratum radiatum by stimulating the CA3 with a concentric bipolar electrode, and recorded in current-clamp mode, using the HEKA EPC-10 USB amplifier with a glass pipette (3–7 MΩ) filled with NaCl (3 M). After recording a 15-min baseline, the LTP was induced by a four-train high-frequency stimulus (50 pulses at 100 Hz, with 10 s intervals) and recorded for 60 min.

### TS staining

TS staining was performed as previously described[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."). Briefly, the brain sections were incubated in 0.002% TS (T1892-25G, Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 min in 50% ethanol at room temperature. This step was followed by two washes with 50% ethanol and three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The brain sections were subsequently mounted for imaging.

### Immunofluorescence

The brain tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated with 30% sucrose and coronally cut into 40-μm sections using a cryostat (CM3050S, Leica). For immunofluorescence staining, brain sections were blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA, 3% horse serum, and 0.3% Triton-X 100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. We used the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-6E10 (SIG-39320, Covance; 1:500), goat polyclonal anti-Iba1 (NB100-1028, Novus Biologicals; 1:400), rabbit Polyclonal GFAP antibody (Z0334, Dako; 1:1,000). The immunofluorescent signals were labeled with fluorescent secondary antibodies, as follows: donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H + L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 647 ([A32787](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A32787), Thermo Fisher Scientific); donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 488 ([A32814](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A32814), Thermo Fisher Scientific); and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 568 ([A10042](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A10042), Thermo Fisher Scientific). The images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Nikon).

### Western blotting

Western blotting was performed as previously described[59](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR59 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Positive feedback regulation of microglial glucose metabolism by histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation in Alzheimer’s disease. Cell Metab. 34, 634–648 (2022)."). Briefly, brain tissues were lysed with a RIPA lysis buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assays for equal loading. After heat denaturation, equal amounts of protein were separated in the lysates by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Millipore) membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive proteins were then detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate and visualized with autoradiography film (Kodak). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-6E10 (SIG-39320, Covance; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-Iba1 (019-19741, Wako; 1:1,000), mouse anti-GFAP (MAB360, Millipore; 1:2,000), rabbit anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448) (#2971 S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-mTOR (#2972 S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-p62 (#5114 S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000), rabbit anti-LC3 (#4599 S, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000) and mouse anti-β-actin (66009-1-lg, Proteintech; 1:2,000). The used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were as follows: Peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (111-035-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch), peroxidase AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (115-035-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch).

### ELISA

ELISAs of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 were performed as previously described with slight modifications[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."). Briefly, frozen hippocampal tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail ([B14001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/B14001), Biotool), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as soluble fractions. The RIPA-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 2% SDS and 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as insoluble fractions. The levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 were measured using ELISA kits (DAB140B and DAB140B, R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing

16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed at Novogene Bioinformatics. Briefly, total genome DNA obtained from stool samples was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA quality was analyzed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis; DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The bacterial V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified using specific primers with the barcode on a thermocycler PCR system. The PCR products were purified and used for library construction. The sequencing library was generated using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit 48 rxns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions and the quality of the library was assessed on the Qubit@ 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific). The constructed library was sequenced on an Ion S5 XL platform and 400 bp/600 bp single-end reads were generated.

Single-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and truncated by cutting off the barcode and primer sequence. Quality filtering on the raw reads was performed under specific filtering conditions to obtain high-quality clean reads according to Cutadapt (version 1.9.1, [http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). The reads were compared to the reference database (Silva database, [https://www.arb-silva.de/](https://www.arb-silva.de/)) using the UCHIME algorithm ([http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uchime_algo.html](http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uchime_algo.html)). We next removed the chimeric sequences. The acquired clean reads were used for subsequent analyses on the Uparse software (Uparse version 7.0.1001, [http://drive5.com/uparse/](http://drive5.com/uparse/)). Sequences with ≥97% similarity were assigned to the same OTUs, and a representative sequence for each OTU was screened for further annotation. For each representative sequence, the Silva Database ([https://www.arb-silva.de/](https://www.arb-silva.de/)) was used to annotate taxonomic information based on the Mothur algorithm. In order to study phylogenetic relationship between different OTUs, and the differences between the dominant species present in the different groups, we conducted multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31, [http://www.drive5.com/muscle/](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/)). The abundance of OTUs was normalized using a standard sequence number corresponding to the sample with the least number of sequences. Subsequent analyses of alpha and beta diversities were performed on the normalized output data.

### Untargeted metabolomics

Cecal contents were collected after the mice were euthanized (six male mice and six female mice for WT-AL and 5XFAD-AL groups, six male mice and five female mice for 5XFAD-IF group). Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed at the Metabo-Profile Biotechnology. Briefly, each sample (~10 mg) was collected and stored in the Eppendorf Safelock microcentrifuge tube, and mixed with 10 μl prechilled zirconium oxide beads and 20 μl deionized water. The sample was homogenized for 3 min, after which we added 120 μl of methanol containing internal standard to the metabolite extract. Each sample was then homogenized for another 3 min and centrifuged at 18, 000 _g_ for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate. The following procedures were performed on a Biomek 4000 workstation (Biomek 4000, Beckman Coulter): 20 μl of freshly prepared derivative reagents was added to each well. The plate was sealed and the derivatization was carried out at 30 °C for 60 min. After derivatization, the sample was evaporated for 2 h and reconstituted with 330 μl of ice-cold 50% methanol solution. Then the plate was stored at −20 °C for 20 min, followed by 4,000 _g_ centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min. A total of 135 μl supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate with 10 μl internal standard in each well. Serial dilutions of derivatized stock standards were added to the left wells. Finally, the plate was sealed for UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The raw data files generated by UPLC-MS/MS were processed using MassLynx software (version 4.1, Waters) to perform peak integration, calibration, and quantitation for each metabolite.

### Measurement of Sar and DMG

Levels of Sar and DMG in the serum and brain samples of mice were detected as previously described[60](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR60 "Chen, J., Zhang, J., Zhang, W. & Chen, Z. Sensitive determination of the potential biomarker sarcosine for prostate cancer by LC-MS with N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide derivatization. J. Sep. Sci. 37, 14–19 (2014)."). Briefly, 75 μl serum and 275 μl acetonitrile were mixed thoroughly, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C to precipitate the proteins. The supernatants were collected and added with 150 μl 10 mM _N_′_N_′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dissolved in ddH2O and acetonitrile, 1:1). The solutions were mixed well and sealed, then derivatized in a 60 °C water bath for 12 h. The derivatized solutions were centrifugated at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for the following UPLC-MS procedures.

For brain samples, brain hemisphere without cerebellum was collected and homogenized in 350 μl lysis buffer (75 μl ddH2O and 275 μl acetonitrile), followed by centrifugation at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube and added with 150 μl 10 mM _N_′_N_′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The tube was mixed thoroughly and sealed, followed by derivatization reaction in a 60 °C water bath for 12 h. The derivatized solutions were centrifugated at 20,000 _g_ for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected for the subsequent UPLC-MS analysis.

UPLC-MS analysis was performed with a QTRAP 6500+ system and 1 μl of samples or standards was injected. The mobile phase was 0.1% formic acid (diluted in ddH2O) and acetonitrile, and the flow rate was 0.3 ml min−1. The levels of Sar and DMG were calculated according to the standard curves.

### Statistical analysis

The details for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Other than gut microbiome and cecum metabolome data, the remaining data are expressed as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office Excel (2019) and GraphPad Prism (version 8) software. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but sample sizes are similar to those previous reports[57](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR57 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Sodium rutin ameliorates Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology by enhancing microglial amyloid-beta clearance. Sci. Adv. 5, eaau6328 (2019)."),[59](/articles/s43587-022-00311-y#ref-CR59 "Pan, R. Y. et al. Positive feedback regulation of microglial glucose metabolism by histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation in Alzheimer’s disease. Cell Metab. 34, 634–648 (2022).") to generate statistically significant results. The significance of the observed differences was assessed using two tail unpaired Student’s _t-_test (for two groups) or one-way or two-way ANOVA (for more than two groups), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Significance was set at _P_ < 0.05 and expressed as _*P_ < 0.05, _**P_ < 0.01 and _***P_ < 0.001.
