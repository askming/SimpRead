[](#job-search-visualizer)Job Search Visualizer
===============================================

This is a quick tool I made to visualize the calls I made during my thorough job search. It returns two plots.

1.  a timeline for each company with per-interview types. [![](https://github.com/natolambert/job-search-viz/raw/main/_assets/interviews-sorted-new.png)](/natolambert/job-search-viz/blob/main/_assets/interviews-sorted-new.png)
2.  a bar plot showing relative density of networking and interview calls. [![](https://github.com/natolambert/job-search-viz/raw/main/_assets/calls.png)](/natolambert/job-search-viz/blob/main/_assets/calls.png)
